# Stuff here is for later u


### events.MultiWaiter

- Provides a way to wait on multiple events from the bot and get either the first, or all as they happen

- This should get used in rolemanagement, mentionhelp (pending uspstream), and a WIP raid manager

### redutils

- A couple behavioral wrappers which I may decide to PR in a (slightly) more dev friendly way later
