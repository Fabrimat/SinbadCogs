I left Red.

I originally was going to leave the details out and just walk away.
After further behavior even after leaving, I no longer think that's appropriate.


I left because people on the project were going
around bad mouthing other people on the project in other,
semi-public places, to where word of this got around on top of it.


This was the final action which led to me leaving, but one of the reasons
I was already considering it, was that people on the project wouldn't give feedback
about things that needed handling, but then complained about the solutions.


So I stopped fixing things that people didn't give feedback on.


Within a day of me leaving, apparently 3 QA members and another frequent contributor
with access to the channel where these discussions happened are now apparently in
agreement about killing a functionality I wanted to fix,
but couldn't get any feedback about, even when actively soliciting it from them.


So yeah, The people in the Red server still on the project.


That's the people who are now in charge of the direction the bot goes.


Be careful you don't find yourself locked
into using a bot supported by people who
don't care to fix things for petty reasons.
