I left Red.

I originally was going to leave the details out and just walk away.
After further behavior even after leaving, I no longer think that's appropriate.


I left because people on the project were going
around bad mouthing other people on the project in other,
semi-public places, to where word of this got around on top of it.


This was the final action which led to me leaving, but one of the reasons
I was already considering it, was that people on the project wouldn't give feedback
about things that needed handling, but then complained about the solutions.


So I stopped fixing things that people didn't give feedback on.


Within a day of me leaving, apparently 3 QA members and another frequent contributor
with access to the channel where these discussions happened are now apparently in
agreement about killing a functionality I wanted to fix,
but couldn't get any feedback about, even when actively soliciting it from them.


So yeah, The people in the Red server still on the project.


That's the people who are now in charge of the direction the bot goes.


Be careful you don't find yourself locked
into using a bot supported by people who
don't care to fix things for petty reasons.

### Update (2020-02-28)

I've been reuctant to write more about this. There are a few places where
no matter what I do (including a choice of inaction) I'm stuck in a position
where I'm working against at least one facet of things I care about.

Before I add more information, I have left the above intact (not just via git history)
though there was one portion which I later found out was inaccurate

To clarify on the above:

  * In the linked issue, it was only some of the people who led to me seeing
    no better personal option than to leave the project who were in full support.
    The rest was just ambiguous because of phrasing until after what I had written.

  * It did lead to 2 DMs with people still with the project.
    One of those DMs led to clarifying the not actual agreement about things.


With that clarity in place, here's the update on what's happened since, and why I'm speaking up more now.

I got a DM from 26 (https://github.com/twentysix26) and owner of the Red server.
(only after what I've written here above)

26 went on to defend the actions that led to me leaving more abrupty.

"having now seen the original conversation it's... really not that bad."

Which completely missed the point. I have no issues with people wanting to throw criticism.
I took issue with people doing this sort of thing in their own little groups with no intention
of improving things rather than bringing it up in any of the appropriate places such as the meeting, or
in the discord channel as something to be improved on.

He then went on to go just short of telling me to take this post down saying:

"I especially hope not to see this kind of stuff again (which I understand it's on your personal repo but it still has visibility)"

I take a exception to this.

Everything I've written here is true, not covered under any legal expectation of privacy.

While the two quotes above are from direct messages, as it reflects on the project as coming from
the person in charge of the project while speaking about the project,
and these are the first DMs 26 has bothered to send 
(not when I originally pointed out the issue,
 not when I left because it kept going on with nobody responding,
 but only when I posted publicly about it) 

I don't think there's a reasonable expectation that I am complacent in keeping
the issues with the project and the people working on it out of the public view
for users to not have the information needed to make an informed decision about
whether Red should be considered well managed as it relates to a decision to use it.

I refrained from using any official communication channels belonging to
Red (the project) to send this information out as it would have been inappropirate to do so,
but I will not have someone tell me I should not say it at all.
